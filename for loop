/* Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has 3 properties: title (a string), author (a string), alreadyRead (a boolean to note if you've read it yet).

Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and its author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".

Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you've read it yet or not. If you've read it, log a string: 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien'; if not, log a string: 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'
