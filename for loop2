//1. Create a list of people you intend to send holiday cards. Write a for loop to display a custom greeting inside each card. For example, the custom greeting can be: "Dear [name], Happy Holidays!"

var greeting = ["Rev","Catie","Magical","Tia","classmates"];

function message(card) {
 for (var i=0; i<card.length; i++){
   console.log("Dear " + card[i] + " , Happy Holidays!")
} 
} 
message(greeting);


 

var name = ["Rev","Catie","Magical","Tia","classmates"];

for (var i=0; i<name.length; i++){
   console.log("Dear " + name[i] + " , Happy Holidays!")
} 





//2. A college student's cloud drive has a whole bunch of items. Write a for loop that looks for a file with the title of "essay". When successful, print: "The essay has been found." If unsuccessful, print: "There are no matches in this folder for the title searched."


// why it printed out several times????
var myDrive = ["English", "essay", "science"];

function findFile(drive) {
  var search = prompt('what file are you looking for?');
  if (search) {
    alert("Please wait while we look for your file.")
  }
  for (var i=0; i<drive.length ; i++) {
    if (drive[i] === search){
      console.log("The file named " + search + " has been found." )
    } else {
      console.log("There are no matches in this folder for the title searched.")
    }
  }
}
findFile(myDrive);


//3. A donor has photos in .jpg format of each of her handbags, which she wishes to upload for auction to raise funds for her favorite charity. The website is handbags4all.org. Create a for loop that prints the absolute path for each .jpg file to display in the browser.
//Bonus: select one of the exercises and refactor using a function that accepts argument(s).


var photos = ['clothes','laptop','gloves'];

function path(jpg) {
  for (var i=0; i<jpg.length; i++){
    console.log(jpg[i] + " .jpg");
  }
}

photos.push('utensil')
path(photos);
