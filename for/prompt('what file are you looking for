//2. A college student's cloud drive has a whole bunch of items. Write a for loop that looks for a file with the title of "essay". When successful, print: "The essay has been found." If unsuccessful, print: "There are no matches in this folder for the title searched."


var myDrive = ["English", "essay", "science"];

function findFile(drive) {
  var search = prompt('what file are you looking for?');
  if (search) {
    alert("Please wait while we look for your file.")
  }
  for (var i=0; i<drive.length ; i++) {
    if (drive[i] === search){
      console.log("The file named " + search + " has been found." )
    } else {
      console.log("There are no matches in this folder for the title searched.")
    }
  }
}
findFile(myDrive);
