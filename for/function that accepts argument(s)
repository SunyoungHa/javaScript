//3. A donor has photos in .jpg format of each of her handbags, which she wishes to upload for auction to raise funds for her favorite charity. The website is handbags4all.org. Create a for loop that prints the absolute path for each .jpg file to display in the browser.
//Bonus: select one of the exercises and refactor using a function that accepts argument(s).


var photos = ['clothes','laptop','gloves'];

function path(jpg) {
  for (var i=0; i<jpg.length; i++){
    console.log(jpg[i] + " .jpg");
  }
}

photos.push('utensil')
path(photos);
